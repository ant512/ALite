V3.0

 - Split DBObject and DBObjectCollection interfaces into separate files.
 - Added Tests project.
 - Minor optimisations to SetProperty() and Undo() methods of DBObject.
 - Added locking to various places in DBObject and DBObjectCollection to
   fix potential problems in multithreaded applications.
 - DBObjectCollection.Clear() removes all of the list's event listeners from
   the child objects.
 - Refactored delegate and simple validation lists into their own classes.
 - Completely refactored simple validation system to be extensible; added:
   - IValidationRule interface;
   - StringLengthValidationRule class;
   - IntegerBoundsValidationRule class;
   - DateBoundsValidationRule class.
 - Removed "propertyName" and "oldValue" parameters from "Validator" delegate
   signature as they are unused.
 - Simple validation system returns error messages in the same way as the
   delegate validation system.
 - DBObject.Undo() catches any TargetInvocationException errors and re-raises
   them as UndoException errors.
 - Added DictionaryList class to store multiple values for a single key in a
   dictionary; used by the simple validation system.
 - Delegate validation system uses a dictionary and multicast delegates to
   store, locate and call the correct methods for each validation function.
 - Delegate validation system can be used with anonymous methods.
 - Validation errors are passed around in a list instead of in a string.
 - Validation system runs all validators before returning the result, instead of
   failing at the first error.
 - DBObject's OnPropertyChanged event only fires if the property is actually
   changed.
